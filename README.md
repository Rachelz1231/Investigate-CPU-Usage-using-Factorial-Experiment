# Investigate-CPU-Usage-using-Factorial-Experiment
This is a project completed in STA305: Design and Analysis of Experiments

## Introduction
Computers have been an unavoidable part of our life. As students studying data analysis, we have to use computers almost every day. Sometimes when I use my computer, it becomes very slow and the screen is even frozen. I found that it is the result of high CPU usage. CPU is the physical part responsible for processing tasks in a computer(Britannica, 2018), and people can monitor CPU usage to prevent the system from crashing. I am curious to know which task I run on my computer causes high CPU usage. Therefore, the goal of this study is to find out how CPU usage is affected when different tasks are running on the computer.
